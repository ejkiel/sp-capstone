# Capstone Project
*Elizabeth Kiel*

The original Twitter data for this project were collected in Spring 2022 as part of my final project in CS 315 (Data & Text Mining for the Web) by Professor Eni Mustafaraj. In my original project, I analyzed sociological trends of Spotify music sharing on Twitter, namely surrounding the existence of online cultural groups that reflect Spotify-designated genres. Given the time that has elapsed since the original Twitter data were collected, I will examine the extent to which different Twitter popularity metrics may predict Spotify song popularity in the long-term (i.e., one year) future.
